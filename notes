cross cutting parameters
  projection of all layers as a tensor
state handling jit
automatic migration from linen to nnx
freezing subset of parameters

DORA generalize: QR, or polar decomposition
VERA is tensor rank decomposition followed by rescalings on particular groupings of factors, can rescale on all groupings
can make tensor implicitly restricted from in VERA trainable also
